Python Precision: Building a Dynamic 2D Fitts' Law Experiment for Target Clicking and Randomized Spawning


Build a simple 2D Fittsâ€™ Law experiment in the programming language of your choice (which should be capable of creating graphical user interfaces), which shows circles as targets. The user has to use an input device (e.g., mouse, touch) to click on the targets. When the user clicked the target, the next target spawns at a random position, which is at least 30 pixels away from the previous one. Repeat this procedure for 90 targets.



If the user misses the target, nothing should happen. Further, make sure that all targets are displayed fully inside the screen and that they are not cut off at the borders.

Consider 3 different target sizes: 10px, 30px, and 50px (you might change these values if necessary). Each target size should be displayed 30 times during the 90 trials.
